# AE-StickPropertiesTool

This is a script that allow you to **change special properties quickly** yes. But it especially help you **add expression so the properties changed itself** (accordingly to the composition or to its own shape).

Confused ? It’s ok, let’s take it one at the time.



## Position :

- *Click* : change the position of a layer to the corner of your choice, accordingly to the anchor point.
- *... + shift* : Change the position of the layer to the corner of your choice, accordingly to its shape & size
- *... + alt* : add an expression to the position, and slider so you can offset it.

## Anchor point :

This one was mostly created for text layer, but it works for everything. You know what I mean, when you change the size of your text layer or even the font, the anchor point don’t follow. So, you will have a centered anchor point, you change the font, you have to re-centered it, re-change the position, and you want another the font size so you have to re-re-centered it, re-re-change the position… Ain’t nobody got time for that.

- *Click* : change the position of your anchor point accordingly to the shape of your layer
- *... + alt* : add an expression so the anchor point stay centered or at the corner.

## Scale :

- *Click* : change the scale accordingly to the layer shape and the composition size
- *crossIcon Click* :  the scale of the layer will be the bigger without exceeding from the composition.
- *Shift + crossIcon Click* :  change the scale of the layer so exceed the composition for the width or the height depending of the ratio.
- *... + alt* : Add an expression to the scale, and slider so you can offset it.


So always pressed Alt when you want an expression to be added.
